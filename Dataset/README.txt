In the CAMELS folder, there are two types of files. 
The .txt files are the groundwater level data directly downloaded from the USGS website.(https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/gw)
The .csv files contain two subparts: 1) the CAMELS data (https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels) sets of one HUC; 
                                     2) the corresponding groundwater water level data of the HUC.

In the GRACE folder, 
ALL types of data for a specific region, which are collected from NASA Giovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/), are merged into one .csv file.
